#Dog price calculator

Here is the happy news for the dog lovers like you. A new device for dog lovers has come to the market. It checks the health of dogs and their details are stored to a file.
So we need a supporting application for the device to calculate the value of dogs.

Requirements: 1. The application reads the dog data(dog name, dog type- guard dog, family dog, hunting dog and their health level in percent)

2. The calculateValue() method on the dogs should calculate value using the following formula,

	a) ((healthLevel+20)/100)*10000 if the dog is a family dog
	b) ((healthLevel+10)/100)*12000 if the dog is a guard dog
	c) ((healthLevel+20)/100)*15000 if the dog is a hunting dog
