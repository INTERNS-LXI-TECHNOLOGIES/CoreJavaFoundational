Gopi  : So... Happy journey..
Veena : Where will you go again?
Gopi  : I haven't decided yet... I'll have to make some money somehow.. I'll get mad if I stay longer over here..
Veena : Why did you take the responsibility then?
Gopi  : There was a light in front of me. But now..........
Veena : But you...
Gopi  : (Clears throat)
Veena : Where did you go?
Gopi  : I went to the restroom
Veena : Why did you cry?
Gopi  : No I haven't cried... something went inside my eyes
Veena : ok
Gopi  : Train is coming.. (gives some money) Here take this.. I have only this left and you may need it to meet your travel expenses... All your wishes will be fulfilled and I'll pray for it 
Veena : mm
Gopi  : The earth is round so if we are destined to meet then we will meet somewhere
Veena : Look. Are you searching for this?
Gopi  : (surprised)
Veena : If you would come with me and stay helping me then I'll reward you with this
Gopi  : Here I come. I'll ensure that you get married before doing anything else
