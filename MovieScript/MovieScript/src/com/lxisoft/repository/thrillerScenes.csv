Gopi  : Its written to marry you is on Veena's head only. That is why all happening like this
Felix : Who are you to her?
Gopi  : We are relatives. In a same family , that is the reason I came here to discuss about this
Felix : that is true, we had a relationship. But she also told me that her father will allow. Finally she came alone with nothing, what will i do with her after marriage without cash?
Gopi  : She is ready to live with you on any situations. She is loving you that much
Felix : No anybody ready to spoil life like that. I'm ready to marry her, but without getting money my father will never allow this. I can't do anything by hurting my father.
Gopi  : Will you agree if you get the money?
Felix : From where?
Gopi  : I'll give you the money
Felix : From where?
Gopi  : I don't think her family like to see that she is suffering due to some cash issues. I can get you the cash
Felix : Then I'll make my father agree
Gopi  : You go and talk with Veena first. I'm responsible for giving cash to you before marriage
Felix : hmm
Gopi  : She don't want to know that we already talked about this here. She will come and meet you. Try to forget everything
Felix : I still love her, and I'll marry her once the cash problem is solved
Gopi  : Don't want to go down on your love with the money you are spending. Don't make her suffer. Better inform me. I'll take care of her
