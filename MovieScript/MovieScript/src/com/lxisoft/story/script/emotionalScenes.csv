Hero     : So... Happy journey..
Heroine  : Where will you go again?
Hero     : I haven't decided yet... I'll have to make some money somehow.. I'll get mad if I stay longer over here..
Heroine  : Why did you take the responsibility then?
Hero     : There was a light in front of me. But now..........
Heroine  : But you...
Hero     : (Clears throat)
Heroine  : Where did you go?
Hero     : I went to the restroom
Heroine  : Why did you cry?
Hero     : No I haven't cried... something went inside my eyes
Heroine  : ok
Hero     : Train is coming.. (gives some money) Here take this.. I have only this left and you may need it to meet your travel expenses... All your wishes will be fulfilled and I'll pray for it 
Heroine  : mm
Hero     : The earth is round so if we are destined to meet then we will meet somewhere
Heroine  : Look. Are you searching for this?
Hero     : (surprised)
Heroine  : If you would come with me and stay helping me then I'll reward you with this
Hero     : Here I come. I'll ensure that you get married before doing anything else
