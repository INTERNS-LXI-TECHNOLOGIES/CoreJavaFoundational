           +-----------------------------------+

                   ( OUTSIDE THE CHURCH ) 
       
           ** Hazel waits for her Mom’s car to appear 

          ** Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy Augustus standing right next to her. **

         + actor[0] + : I thought we were in a church basement but apparently we were literally in the  heart of Jesus.

         ** Hazel smiles. **

         + actor[1] +: Someone should probably tell him dont you think? Jesus? Seems kinda dangerous  keeping all these kids with cancer in  your heart.

         ** Gus laughs. **

         + actor[0] +: What's your name?

         + actor[1] +: Hazel.
        
         + actor[0] +: No your full name...

        ** Hazel confused **

        + actor[1] +: Hazel Grace Lancaster.

       ** Gus nods to himself smiles. Still fixated on her. **

       ** Hazel Continued ** 

        + actor[1] +: What?

        + actor[0] +: I did not say anything.

        + actor[1] +: Why are you looking at me like that?

        + actor[0] +: Because you are beautiful.

       ** Hazel is taken aback. No one’s ever said that to her before.

        ** Gus Continued **

        + actor[0] +: I enjoy looking at beautiful people and I  decided a while back not to deny myself  the simpler pleasures of existence. 
                         Particularly given that as you soastutely pointed out we are all gonna die pretty soon.

        + actor[1] +: Iam not beaut --
