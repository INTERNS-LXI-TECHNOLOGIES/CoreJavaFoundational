who are you,Why do You care,Oh i see But You cant Stop me,You cant stop me its my destiny,When iam done half of humanity still exist perfectly balanced As all things should be,I am Thanos,I am Here For The Infinity Stones,Why are are you standing in my way,no matter what i will fullfill my destiny,As you wish i am inevitable
