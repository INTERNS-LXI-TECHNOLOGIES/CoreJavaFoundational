      ( OUTSIDE THE CHURCH ) 
       
         ** Hazel waits for her Mom’s car to appear **

        ** Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing right next to her. **

       : I thought we were in a church basement but apparently we were literally in the  heart of Jesus.

       ** Hazel smiles. **

       : Someone should probably tell him, dont you think? Jesus? Seems kinda dangerous  keeping all these kids with cancer in  your heart.

         ** Gus laughs. **

         : What's your name?

        : Hazel.
        
          : No your full name...

         ** Hazel confused **

         : Hazel Grace Lancaster.

         ** Gus nods to himself, smiles. Still fixated on her. ** 

       ** Hazel Continued **

        : What?

        : I did not say anything.

         : Why are you looking at me like that?

       : Because you are beautiful.

       ** Hazel is taken aback. No one’s ever said that to her before. **

         ** Gus Continued **

          : I enjoy looking at beautiful people and I  decided a while back not to deny myself  the simpler pleasures of existence.
          Particularly given that, as you soastutely pointed out, we are all gonna die pretty soon.

        : Iam not beaut --

        
      **Scene: Monica and Rachel's, late at night Monica is still examining her bill as Rachel emerges from her room.**

       : Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing.

     : This woman's living my life.

         : What?

       : She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see.
         She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies.
        
         : You're not an artist.
   
        : Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't.

       : Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things.

        : Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we.

        : (Yawning) Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'...

        : Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?

       : (Yawning) Nooo...
        
        : This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother.

        **Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Chandler are discussing stage names.**

        : How about Joey... Pepponi?

        : No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral.

         : Joey... Switzerland?

       *The waitress brings their coffee.*

       : Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big. (Waitress looks at him funny) Which I'm not.

        : Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?

        : Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.

       : Well, it does not ring a bell with me...

       : (Writes it down) Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good.

        : Might wanna try Joseph.

        *Joey visibly thinks 'Of course!' and writes it down.*

        : Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!

        : Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof.
        
       

          (HERENGRACHT CANAL - DAY 121) 
        
        *They stroll across a footbridge. Hazel notices he’s struggling with something.*

        : Augustus?

        *Gus takes a cigarette out, sticks it between his lips.*

        HAZEL (CONT’D)

        : What is it?

        : There’s something I have to tell you...They walk in silence a few beats.

         GUS (CONT’D)

      : Just before you went into the hospital...There was this... I felt this... ache in my hip.

        *Hazel grabs onto his arm, a lump already forming.Gus takes the cigarette out of his mouth, clenches his teeth  tightly, trying not to cry.*

       GUS (CONT’D) 

        : It lit up like a Christmas tree, Hazel.The lining of my chest, my liver... everywhere

        *Hazel loses it in that moment, hugging him for dear life, her  head in his lap.*

        : I’m so sorry, Augustus. I’m so so sorry -- 

        : I’m sorry too -- 

         : It’s so unfair --

        : I should have told you --

        : It’s so fucking unfair!  

        **A beat. Gus still trying not to cry.** 

        : Apparently the world is... not a wish granting factory.

         GUS (CONT’D) 

        : Don’t you worry about me, Hazel Grace. I’ll find a way to hang around and annoy you for a long time.

        **She hugs him, perhaps a little too tightly. He winces.**

        : Does it hurt? 

        : It’s ok.
         : I’m ok.

         : Ok. 

         **Hazel takes a moment to look at him, touches his cheek.** 

        : What? 

        : I’m just... I’m very fond of you. He grabs her hand and holds it.

        : I don’t suppose you can forget about it, treat me like I’m not dying. 

        : I don’t think you’re dying, Augustus. You’ve just got a touch of cancer Gus nods. Squeezes her hand.
