#MvdFineCalculator

Our motor vehicle department has to develop a new application to calculate the fine for drivers who violate the traffic rules.

requirements: The vehicle data they collected is stored in a file(vehicle number, vehicle wheelers- Two wheeler, Four Wheeler and Heavy Vehicle, valid license present, valid RC present, valid insurance present). Read the vehicle details from the file and print the fine to be issued for each vehicle(use the calculateFine() method)

Fine is calculated using the following formula

No valid RC(nrc) = 10000 for a two-wheeler, 15000 for Four wheeler and 25000 for heavy vehicle
no insurance(nins) = 2000 for a two-wheeler, 5000 for Four wheeler and 15000 for heavy vehicle
no license(nlic) = 1500 for a two-wheeler, 2500 for Four wheeler and 5000 for heavy vehicle

total = nrc+nins+nlic)

try to implement: package, inheritance and file operations
