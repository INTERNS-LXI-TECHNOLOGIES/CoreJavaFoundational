## Fast-Tag Checker ##

* Create a project to check wether the vehicle has got Fast-Tag or not. If the vehicle has got the tag then print "You Can Go Now".
* If it does not have a Fast-Tag then ask for one direction or two. Depending on the direction print the reciept showing the amount that to be paid.
* You should also have a number of objects pre-stored to compare with the new entry.
* Use for loop for Comparison.
